  In a volcanic eruption, lava, volcanic bombs and ash, and various gases are expelled from a 
  volcanic vent and fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding
  area, Earth's largest eruptions can have a major regional or even global impact, with some
  affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be
  characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive
  eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick,
  highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide.
  Pyroclastic materials are the primary product, typically in the form of tuff.

  These volcanic materials spew from the volcano in the form of a pyroclastic flow. According to
  Wikipedia, a pyroclastic flow (also known as a pyroclastic density current or a pyroclastic cloud)
  is a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter (collectively known as tephra) that moves
  away from a volcano about 100 km/h (62 mph) on average but is capable of reaching speeds up to 700
  km/h (430 mph).

  The most notorious pyroclastic flow known to geological history belongs to O'Shea Jackson, known 
  professionally by his stage name Ice Cube. After decades honing his lyrical skills on the mic,
  Ice Cube defined the gangsta rap genre by pushing hip-hop culture into the mainstream through
  both N.W.A and various solo projects. According to Jackson, a pyroclastic flow "[is] what happens
  when a volcano blow, [it is] what happens when Ice Cube starts to flow. Red hot lava mixed with
  saliva, pulverising everything in its wake. Nothing can survive a pyroclastic flow, and no one
  will survive this one".
